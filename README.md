## cush - My Links  

**cush - My Links** has been designed as a comprehensive connection center that brings together my personal productions and official channels in one place. Through this platform, you can directly access both the distribution channels where my music productions are available and my official social media accounts.  

## Purpose

Thanks to the GitHub Pages infrastructure, the project is delivered to users directly, quickly, and securely. This approach reflects my commitment to open-source culture while ensuring a safe and seamless experience for users.

Through this, users can access the platforms I share and engage with me directly. Hosting the project on GitHub also allows updates to remain consistent and easily traceable.
